      "Nvidia stock got a boost in today's trading as investors and analysts reassessed the impact of a potential delay for the first generation of the company's upcoming Blackwell processors.

      "The first releases in the Blackwell line are expected to deliver a substantial leap forward in processing power and were expected to be a major performance driver for Nvidia this year.

The chipmaker traditionally known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) that have powered industries like gaming, crypto, and autonomous vehicles, has emerged as the clear leader in artificial intelligence (AI) chips as its technology is also well suited to running the kind of deep learning models that programs like ChatGPT require.\n",
